## 2. River Overview: America's First National Scenic Riverway

### The Birth of a Protected Treasure

The Current River made history on August 27, 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the bill creating the **Ozark National Scenic Riverways**—the first national park area established to protect a river system. This groundbreaking conservation effort preserved 134 miles of the Current River and Jacks Fork rivers, ensuring that future generations could experience these waterways as wild and free-flowing.

The push for protection came after decades of threats. In the 1940s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed damming the Current River for hydroelectric plants—a plan that would have drowned the river's spectacular springs and bluffs beneath reservoirs. Conservationists, led by visionaries like Missouri Governor Herbert Hadley (who famously floated the river in 1909) and wilderness advocate Leonard Hall, fought for years to save the river. Their efforts culminated in the 1964 Act of Congress, with formal dedication occurring in 1971 when Patricia Nixon Cox cut the ribbon at Big Spring.

### Geographic Context: The Heart of the Missouri Ozarks

The Current River flows 184 miles through the rugged Ozark Highlands of southeastern Missouri, carving its path through Shannon, Carter, Dent, and Texas counties. The river begins at the confluence of Pigeon Creek and Montauk Springs in **Montauk State Park** (Dent County) and meanders southeast until it joins the Black River in Pocahontas, Arkansas.

The river's watershed lies within the **Mark Twain National Forest** and the **Ozark National Scenic Riverways**, creating a corridor of protected wilderness rarely found east of the Rockies. Towns like Van Buren, Eminence, and Doniphan serve as gateways to the river, offering outfitters, lodging, and supplies.

### Why the Current River Reigns Supreme

**Spring-Fed Clarity:** The Current River boasts the highest concentration of first-magnitude springs (those flowing over 100 cubic feet per second) in dolomite rock anywhere in the United States. Major springs like Welch Spring (121 cfs), Cave Spring, Pulltite Spring, Round Spring, Blue Spring, and **Big Spring** (one of the largest springs in the world at 286 million gallons per day) feed the river, ensuring consistent flows and remarkably clear water year-round.

**Year-Round Floatability:** Unlike rain-fed rivers that fluctuate wildly, the Current's spring-fed nature means you can float most sections throughout the year. The most popular sections (Akers to Pulltite, Cedar Grove to Akers) are reliably floatable from spring through fall, while lower sections below Welch Spring can be paddled even in winter.

**Diverse Scenery:** The Current River corridor encompasses:
- Towering 200-foot dolomite bluffs
- Deep blue spring pools you can paddle into
- Gravel bars perfect for camping and picnicking
- Dense hardwood forests exploding with fall color
- Hidden caves and waterfalls

**Wildlife Abundance:** Paddlers regularly spot river otters (the inspiration for Eddy!), bald eagles, great blue herons, kingfishers, white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, and smallmouth bass patrolling clear pools. The river is also home to rainbow and brown trout in upper sections.

**Accessibility:** The Current River strikes a perfect balance—remote enough to feel like wilderness, yet accessible enough with multiple put-ins, nearby towns, and dozens of outfitters ready to shuttle you upriver and provide equipment.

### By the Numbers: Current River's Gradient and Character

- **Overall Gradient:** 4.4 feet per mile (gentle and forgiving)
- **Montauk to Akers:** 8.7 ft/mi (faster upper section)
- **Akers to Jacks Fork Junction:** 5 ft/mi (moderate pace, most popular)
- **Jacks Fork to Big Spring:** 3.8 ft/mi (lazy and scenic)
- **Big Spring to Doniphan:** 3.2 ft/mi (wide and slow, motorboat traffic)

The gradient tells the story: upper sections move briskly with occasional Class I-II riffles, while lower sections meander lazily through broader valleys. Most floaters target the sweet spot between Akers and Round Spring, where the river offers just enough current to keep you moving while providing ample time to soak in the scenery.

## 6. Best Time to Float: Season-by-Season Breakdown

### Spring: March-May (★★★★☆)

**Water Conditions:** High flows from snowmelt and spring rains make this an excellent time for sections that are sometimes low in summer (like the upper Jacks Fork). Water temps range from 50-60°F—chilly but refreshing.

**Crowds:** Light to moderate. Weekends see some traffic, but nothing like summer. Weekdays are nearly empty.

**Scenery:** Wildflowers bloom in April and May; redbuds, dogwoods, and serviceberries paint the bluffs pink and white. Fresh green foliage creates a vibrant backdrop.

**Pros:**
- Fewer crowds mean gravel bars and campsites are easy to find
- Higher water levels allow you to float upper sections (Baptist to Cedar Grove) more easily
- Comfortable air temps (60s-70s) with cool water
- Excellent fishing as bass and trout become more active

**Cons:**
- Cold water requires wetsuits for tubing
- Unpredictable weather (thunderstorms, occasional cold snaps)
- Some outfitters operate limited hours early in season

**Best For:** Experienced paddlers seeking solitude, anglers, photographers

---

### Summer: June-August (★★★★★)

**Water Conditions:** Moderate to low depending on rainfall, but the Current's spring-fed nature ensures it remains floatable. Water temps stay cool (58-65°F) even when air temps soar to 95°F+.

**Crowds:** **Heavy on weekends** (especially Saturdays between Memorial Day and Labor Day). Popular sections like Akers to Pulltite and Cedar Grove to Akers can feel like a parade. Weekdays are much better.

**Pros:**
- Warm air temps make swimming and tubing perfect

---

### Fall: September-November (★★★★★)

**Water Conditions:** Low to moderate. Fall is typically drier, but spring flows keep the river running. Water temps drop to 55-60°F by November.

**Crowds:** Light. After Labor Day, the river empties out. You'll have gravel bars to yourself on weekdays, and even weekends are manageable.

**Scenery:** **Peak fall color mid-October.** The Ozark hardwood forests explode in reds, oranges, and golds. The bluffs framed by autumn leaves are photographer's dream. Early morning fog rising from the water adds to the magic.

**Pro Tip:** Mid-October is the sweet spot—peak color, comfortable weather, and near-total solitude.

---

### Winter: December-February (★★★☆☆)

**Water Conditions:** Low but stable (spring-fed rivers don't freeze easily). Water temps (50-55°F) are actually warmer than air temps on frigid mornings, creating ethereal fog.

**Crowds:** Zero. You'll have the river entirely to yourself.

**Scenery:** Stark beauty. Bare bluffs, clear water, ice formations on banks, fog rising from the warmer water. Bald eagles perch in sycamores.

**Pros:**
- Total solitude (you might not see another person all day)
- Bald eagle sightings (December-February)
- Otherworldly fog and ice formations
- Unique paddling experience

**Cons:**
- Cold air temps (30s-40s)
- Requires drysuit or wetsuit (hypothermia risk)
- Limited outfitter services (most closed Dec-Feb)
- Short daylight hours
- Camping is challenging (freezing nights)

**Best For:** Experienced cold-weather paddlers, wildlife photographers (eagles!), adventurers seeking a unique challenge

**Pro Tip:** January and February offer the best eagle viewing. Bring binoculars and watch for them fishing near Big Spring.

### Water Level Considerations

**Check Real-Time Data:** Before any float, check the USGS gage at Van Buren (Station 07067000): [USGS Current River at Van Buren](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=07067000)

**Ideal Levels:**
- **Below 3 feet:** Low but floatable (more walking/dragging in upper sections)
- **3-5 feet:** Perfect (good flow, easy paddling, gravel bars exposed)
- **5-7 feet:** High (faster current, fewer gravel bars, more challenging)
- **Above 7 feet:** Flood stage (dangerous; avoid floating)

**Spring-Fed Stability:** Unlike rain-fed rivers, the Current rarely experiences extreme fluctuations. Even after heavy rain, the river typically stays within safe floating range within 24-48 hours.

---

### Sun & Weather Protection

**Sunscreen (SPF 50+):**
- Reapply every 2 hours
- Water-resistant formula
- Don't forget back of neck, ears, tops of feet

**Hat with Brim:**
- Wide-brim or baseball cap
- Consider hat leash (so it doesn't blow away)

**Sunglasses with Strap:**
- Polarized lenses help spot rocks underwater

- Better sun protection than sunscreen alone
- Lightweight, quick-dry material

**Rain Jacket:**
- Afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer
- Pack in dry bag

---

### Clothing & Footwear

---

### Food & Hydration

- The Current River is pure, but bring your own drinking water
- Hydration is critical on hot summer days

**Snacks & Lunch:**
- Sandwiches, trail mix, fruit, energy bars
- Pack in waterproof container or cooler
- No glass containers (Missouri law prohibits glass on rivers)

## 9. Tips from Locals: Insider Knowledge

### Hidden Gems

**Float Tuesday or Wednesday:**
Reddit locals consistently recommend mid-week floats. One commenter said: "The BEST days to float this stretch with the fewest floaters are Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Avoid Saturdays between Memorial Day and Labor Day like the plague."

**Akers to Pulltite is the gold standard:**
Multiple local sources call the 10-mile Akers to Pulltite stretch "the best overall single-day float in the Missouri Scenic Rivers region." You get Cave Spring (the centerpiece), gravel bars, minor rapids, and no road noise. As one local put it: "It has just about everything you could want."

**Cave Spring is worth the stop:**
Don't rush past Cave Spring. Locals recommend spending 30-60 minutes here. Paddle into the cave entrance, swim in the brilliant blue pool, take photos, and soak in the magic. One local tip: "If you like to stop a lot and for longer periods to explore and enjoy the river, this 10-mile trip can be turned into an 8-hour trip."

**Early birds get the best campsites:**
Gravel bar camping is first-come, first-served. Start early to claim prime spots. "Put in early enough in the summer, and a 20-mile trip can be done in 8-10 hours if you push," notes a frequent floater.

---

### What to Avoid

**Saturdays in summer:**
Universally despised by locals. "Saturday's are the absolute worst day to float due to crowds," says a regular. If you must float on a weekend, choose Sunday—it's less hectic.

**Don't bring firewood from home:**
Emerald Ash Borer regulations prohibit transporting firewood into Missouri. Gather dead wood on-site or buy locally.

**Stay out of motorboat zones if you want peace:**
Below Big Spring, motorboats are unrestricted. If you want a quiet paddle, stay above Round Spring on the Current or above Alley Spring on the Jacks Fork.

**Glass is illegal and dangerous:**
Missouri law bans glass containers on state waterways. Broken glass on gravel bars is a safety hazard and ruins the experience for everyone. Use cans or plastic.

### Local Insights from Reddit r/Ozarks and r/Missouri

**"Akers to Round Spring on the Current is where it's at."**
One Redditor highlighted this 22-mile stretch as an ideal overnight trip with great camping options and diverse scenery.

**"The Upper Jacks Fork of the Current River is the absolute crown jewel of Missouri Ozarks."**
While this article focuses on the Current River, locals often praise the Jacks Fork (a tributary) as equally stunning, especially the stretch from Buck Hollow (Hwy 17) to Alley Spring when water is high (spring).

**"Big Piney or Gasconade are good options [too]."**
Locals suggest if the Current is too crowded, explore nearby rivers like Big Piney or Gasconade for a quieter experience.

**"Check out river of life farms on the north fork of the white river."**
For those seeking variety, locals recommend nearby float destinations beyond the Current River.

- Blue ribbon section: 18-inch minimum, 1 fish daily limit, hard lures only
