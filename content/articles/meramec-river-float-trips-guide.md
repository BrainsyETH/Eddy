## River Overview

### The Meramec's Place in Missouri River History

The Meramec River has been a transportation corridor and natural resource for thousands of years. Native American tribes used it for fishing and travel, and French explorers named it "Maramec," derived from an indigenous word meaning "catfish." By the 1800s, the river powered mills and supported logging operations throughout Crawford and Franklin counties.

Today, the Meramec is protected as one of Missouri's premier recreational waterways. The upper section between Meramec Spring and Meramec State Park sees thousands of paddlers each summer, while the lower river (below the Bourbeuse confluence) offers a quieter, more developed experience as it approaches the Mississippi River near St. Louis.

### Geographic Context

The Meramec begins near Salem in Dent County, fed by countless Ozark springs including Maramec Spring—Missouri's sixth-largest spring with an average flow of over 96 million gallons per day. From there, it flows northeast through:

- **Dent County:** Upper headwaters, rugged and remote
- **Crawford County:** Steelville area, prime float trip territory
- **Phelps County:** Meramec Spring Park and upper access points
- **Franklin County:** Sullivan, Meramec State Park, Meramec Caverns
- **Jefferson & St. Louis Counties:** Lower river, approaching the Mississippi

The most floated sections run from **Meramec Spring to Meramec State Park** (approximately 60 miles), where outfitters concentrate their services. This stretch offers the best balance of scenery, accessibility, and water quality.

### Why the Meramec Is So Popular

**1. Proximity to St. Louis:** At just 90 minutes from the metro area, the Meramec is the closest high-quality float river for Missouri's largest city. Day trips are easy, weekend trips are effortless.

**2. Spring-Fed Clarity:** Unlike rain-dependent rivers, the Meramec stays clear and floatable most of the year thanks to massive spring inputs. Even in summer, the water remains cool and refreshing.

**3. Beginner-Friendly:** With gentle Class I rapids (occasional Class II in spring), wide channels, and abundant outfitters, the Meramec is perfect for first-timers, families with kids, and anyone who wants a relaxing day on the water.

**4. Endless Gravel Bars:** The Meramec is famous for its gravel bars—perfect for pulling ashore, swimming, picnicking, and letting kids play in shallow water.

**5. Fishing Excellence:** Smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, catfish, and even trout (near Maramec Spring) make the Meramec a year-round angler's destination.

### Difficulty Rating & Why

The Meramec is classified as **Class I** (easy) with occasional **Class II** (novice) rapids during high water. Here's what that means:

**Class I Sections (90% of the river):**
- Gentle riffles and small waves
- Easy to navigate with minimal skill
- Safe for children and non-swimmers (with life jackets)
- Suitable for tubes, rafts, canoes, kayaks

**Class II Sections ("Fun Rapids"):**
- Found near Bird's Nest in Steelville, and scattered throughout
- Small standing waves (1-2 feet)
- Requires basic maneuvering skills
- Might splash you, rarely tips boats
- Exciting for beginners, easy for experienced paddlers

**Obstacles to Watch For:**
- **Log jams:** Especially in upper sections after storms
- **Low-water bridges:** Some remain (with pilings)—paddle around, don't go under
- **Shallow gravel bars:** In late summer, you may need to walk your boat through ankle-deep sections
- **Weekend crowds:** During peak season, traffic on the river can be a bigger challenge than the water itself

### Scenery & Notable Features

**Limestone Bluffs:** Tower 50-100 feet above the water in places, creating dramatic corridors. Watch for cave openings at the waterline.

**Springs:** Crystal-clear spring branches enter throughout the float, each contributing cold, turquoise water. Blue Springs Creek (Mile 78.6) is especially beautiful.

**Gravel Bars:** Endless stretches of white gravel perfect for beach breaks. Expect to see tents, coolers, and groups hanging out on summer weekends.

**Caves:** Onondaga Cave, Fisher Cave (Meramec State Park), Meramec Caverns, and dozens of smaller cave openings visible from the water.

**Wildlife:** Kingfishers, herons, turtles sunning on logs, deer drinking at the bank, and if you're lucky, river otters. Bass and catfish are visible in clear pools.

### Fishing on the Meramec

The Meramec is one of Missouri's best smallmouth bass rivers. Anglers target rocky riffles, deep pools below bluffs, and spring branches.

**Target Species:**
- **Smallmouth Bass:** Most popular, best in spring/fall, 10-16 inches typical
- **Largemouth Bass:** In slower pools and backwaters
- **Catfish:** Channel cats, flatheads in deep holes
- **Trout:** Stocked in Maramec Spring branch (special trout area)

**Best Techniques:**
- Topwater lures early morning and evening
- Tube jigs and soft plastics in pools
- Crankbaits along bluff lines
- Live minnows and crawfish for catfish

**Note:** Missouri fishing license required. Check MDC regulations for limits and seasons.

- Better wildlife viewing
- Our strong recommendation if your schedule allows

### Water Levels & When to Check

Unlike many rivers, the Meramec's spring-fed nature keeps it floatable most of the season. However, it's still wise to check conditions:

**USGS Water Level Gauge (Steelville):**
[waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?07013000](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?07013000)

**Good Floating Levels:**
- **2.5-4.0 feet:** Ideal—good current, no obstacles
- **4.0-6.0 feet:** High water—faster current, Class II rapids more prominent, exciting for experienced paddlers
- **Below 2.5 feet:** Low—expect shallow sections, may need to walk boat, slower float

**Avoid Floating When:**
- **Above 8 feet:** Dangerous—fast current, debris, strainers (fallen trees)
- **After heavy rain (24-48 hours):** River often floods quickly; wait for levels to drop

**Pro Tip:** Call your outfitter before driving down. They know current conditions and will tell you honestly if it's a good day to float.

## What to Bring

### Essential Gear Checklist

**Safety First:**
- ✅ **Life jacket** (provided by outfitter, but check fit)
- ✅ **Whistle** (attach to life jacket)
- ✅ **First aid kit** (waterproof container)
- ✅ **Emergency contact info** (laminated card)

**Sun Protection:**
- ✅ **Sunscreen** (SPF 30+, reef-safe, reapply every 2 hours)
- ✅ **Sunglasses** (polarized with strap—Croakies or similar)
- ✅ **Hat** (wide brim, chin strap—Tilley hats are perfect)
- ✅ **Long-sleeve UV shirt** (optional but recommended for all-day floats)

**Footwear:**
- ✅ **Water shoes** or river sandals (NOT flip-flops—gravel bars will destroy your feet)
- ✅ Chacos, Keens, or similar closed-toe sandals ideal
- ✅ Old sneakers work in a pinch

**Hydration & Food:**
- ✅ **Water bottles** (at least 1 liter per person—hydration is critical in summer heat)
- ✅ **Cooler** (rent from outfitter or bring your own—tie securely to raft/canoe)
- ✅ **Snacks** (trail mix, granola bars, fruit—avoid messy foods)
- ✅ **Lunch** (sandwiches, wraps—keep it simple)
- ✅ **Ice** (you'll want cold drinks)

**Clothing:**
- ✅ **Swimsuit** (wear under shorts/shirt)
- ✅ **Quick-dry shorts and shirt** (avoid cotton—it stays wet and cold)
- ✅ **Extra dry clothes in car** (you'll appreciate this at take-out)
- ✅ **Rain jacket** (if weather looks iffy)

**Waterproof Storage:**
- ✅ **Dry bag** (10-20L for phone, keys, wallet, etc.)
- ✅ **Waterproof phone case** (or leave phone in car—seriously consider it)
- ✅ **Ziplock bags** (backup protection for valuables)

**Optional But Nice:**
- 🔲 **Waterproof camera** (GoPro or similar for photos/video)
- 🔲 **Towel** (microfiber dries fast)
- 🔲 **Fishing gear** (collapsible rod, tackle box—if you have a license)
- 🔲 **River map** (laminated—from MDC or outfitter)
- 🔲 **Trash bag** (pack out what you pack in)
- 🔲 **Duct tape** (fixes everything)

### What NOT to Bring

❌ **Glass containers** (dangerous if broken, often prohibited by outfitters)
❌ **Expensive electronics** (unless waterproofed—assume everything gets wet)
❌ **Valuables** (jewelry, cash beyond $20 emergency fund—leave in locked car)
❌ **Cotton clothing** (stays wet, gets cold—choose synthetic/athletic fabrics)
❌ **Flip-flops** (useless on gravel bars, easy to lose in current)
❌ **Alcohol in excess** (Missouri allows alcohol on rivers, but stay safe and legal—BUI laws apply)

### Packing Tips from the Pros

**1. Everything Gets Wet:** Even in a "dry bag." Double-bag electronics and assume your cooler will leak.

**2. Tie Everything Down:** Coolers, dry bags, paddles—use rope or bungee cords. Losing gear to the current is no fun.

**3. Dress for the Weather + Swimming:** You'll be wet most of the day. Dress accordingly and bring sun protection.

**4. Bring More Water Than You Think:** Floating in 90°F heat is dehydrating. A liter per person minimum.

**5. Leave No Trace:** Pack out all trash. The Meramec is beautiful—help keep it that way.

## Tips from Locals

After dozens of Meramec floats and conversations with outfitters, guides, and locals, here's the insider knowledge:

### Hidden Gems & Insider Spots

**1. Float on Weekday Mornings (May or September)**
"Best float I ever did was a Tuesday in May. Put in at Maramec Spring at 9am. Didn't see another soul for 6 miles. Just us, the kingfishers, and the river."—Local angler

**2. Skip the Peak Weekends**
"Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day—the Meramec turns into a floating parking lot. If you must go on a summer weekend, launch early (8am) or go mid-week."—Outfitter operator

**3. The Best Swimming Holes Are Between Steelville and Onondaga**
"Everyone stops at the first gravel bar. Keep paddling. The best spots are upriver from Onondaga—deep pools below bluffs, spring branches with crystal water."—River guide

**4. Bring Your Fishing Rod**
"The Meramec is a world-class smallmouth river. Even if you're just floating, bring a small tackle box. Topwater lures at dawn = fish every cast."—Local bass tournament angler

**5. Maramec Spring Park Is Worth the Visit**
"Don't skip the spring. It's a 5-minute walk from the parking lot, and it's one of the most beautiful sights in Missouri. Plus, the trout fishing is excellent."—Park ranger

### What to Avoid

**1. Don't Float After Heavy Rain**
"If it rained 2+ inches in the last 24 hours, wait a day. The Meramec floods fast, and you'll be dodging logs and debris."—Search and rescue volunteer

**2. Don't Wear Flip-Flops**
"I can't count how many people I've seen walking barefoot on gravel bars because their flip-flops floated away. Wear water shoes or strappy sandals."—Outfitter staff

**3. Don't Underestimate the Sun**
"You're on the water all day, reflections double UV exposure. I've seen people with 2nd-degree burns. Sunscreen, hat, and reapply."—EMT who works river rescues

**4. Don't Drink Too Much Alcohol**
"Missouri allows drinking on rivers, but BUI (Boating Under the Influence) is a real charge, and drownings happen. Keep it reasonable."—Sheriff's department river patrol

**5. Don't Leave Valuables in Your Car**
"Some access points are remote. Smash-and-grabs happen. Lock your car, hide valuables, or better yet—leave them at home."—Local resident

### Local Wisdom

**Best Meal After a Float:**
"Big Mike's BBQ in Steelville. Get the ribs and burnt ends. Sit outside. You're welcome."—Steelville native

**Best Camping:**
"Meramec State Park is great, but if you want solitude, Huzzah State Forest allows primitive camping. Bring your own everything."—Backpacker

**Best Float for First-Timers:**
"Meramec State Park concession float—5 miles, 2-4 hours, super easy. They put you in the water and pick you up. Can't mess it up."—Park volunteer

**Best Time for Photography:**
"October. Fall colors + low water = gravel bars turn white against orange leaves and blue sky. Bring your camera."—Nature photographer

**Best Float for Fishing:**
"Put in at Bird's Nest (Steelville), take out at Onondaga. About 18 miles. Fish the riffles, bluff pools, and spring branches. All-day trip, but you'll catch fish."—Fishing guide
