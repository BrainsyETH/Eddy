# Essential Gear for Missouri Float Trips: Complete Packing List

## Introduction

Planning your first Missouri float trip? The gear you bring can make the difference between a memorable adventure and a miserable day on the river. Whether you're tackling the Current River's legendary springs or the Meramec's family-friendly stretches, proper preparation ensures safety, comfort, and fun.

This guide breaks down everything you need—from required safety equipment to optional comfort items—with seasonal considerations, budget alternatives, and rental guidance. We'll help you pack smart, avoid common mistakes, and enjoy your float trip to the fullest.

## Required Safety Gear

### Life Jackets (Personal Flotation Devices)

**Missouri Law Requirement:** One U.S. Coast Guard-approved Type I, II, III, or V life jacket per person in your watercraft. Children 6 and under must wear their PFD at all times.

**What to Look For:**
- Type III PFDs are most common for float trips (comfortable, mobile)
- Proper fit: snug but not restrictive, stays in place when lifted at shoulders
- Check for USCG approval stamp (required by law)
- Adults: 16+ lbs of buoyancy
- Children: Size-specific models (infant, child, youth)

**Budget Options:**
- New Type III PFDs: $25-60 (Stearns, O'Neill, NRS)
- Used/thrift stores: Often find like-new condition
- **Outfitter rentals: Usually $5-10/day per person** (check when booking)

**Pro Tip:** Bring your PFD even if not required to wear it constantly. River conditions change, and having it accessible is smart planning.

### First Aid Kit

**Essential Items:**
- Adhesive bandages (various sizes)
- Gauze pads and medical tape
- Antibiotic ointment
- Pain relievers (ibuprofen, acetaminophen)
- Antihistamine (allergic reactions)
- Tweezers (splinters, ticks)
- Scissors
- CPR face shield
- Emergency contact card

**Waterproof Storage:** Store in dry bag or waterproof case. Even a sealed Ziploc works in a pinch.

**Budget Options:** Pre-made waterproof kits ($15-30) or DIY using travel-size pharmacy items ($10-15).

### Throwable Flotation Device

**Missouri Law Requirement:** Vessels 16 feet or longer must carry a Type IV throwable device (cushion or ring buoy).

**Most canoes/kayaks are under 16 feet**, so this isn't required for typical float trips, but it's good practice for groups.

**Pro Tip:** A rope throw bag ($20-40) is more practical than a cushion—easier to deploy and more versatile for rescue situations.

## Essential Personal Items

### Coolers and Water Storage

**Why You Need It:**
- Hydration: Hot Missouri summers + alcohol = dehydration risk
- Food preservation: Keep perishables safe
- Ice: Cools drinks, treats minor injuries

**What to Bring:**
- **Hard cooler (25-50 quarts):** Holds ice longer, doubles as dry seat
- **Soft cooler/dry bag:** Lighter, easier to stow in kayaks
- **1 gallon water per person:** Minimum for day trips
- **Reusable water bottles:** Eco-friendly, reduce trash

**Cooler Tips:**
- Pre-chill cooler night before (fill with ice, drain before packing)
- Use block ice (melts slower than cubes)
- Pack drinks in reverse order (lunch drinks on top, dinner at bottom)
- Freeze water bottles overnight (double duty: ice + cold water as they melt)

**Budget Options:**
- Coleman coolers: $30-60 (proven reliability)
- Styrofoam coolers: $10-15 (single-trip, less eco-friendly)
- Walmart/Academy soft coolers: $15-30

### Dry Bags and Waterproof Storage

**What Needs Protection:**
- Cell phones, cameras, car keys
- Wallets, IDs, cash
- Clothes, towels
- First aid supplies
- Food (if not in cooler)

**Dry Bag Sizes:**
- **10L:** Personal items (phone, wallet, small camera)
- **20L:** Day pack size (clothes, towels, snacks)
- **40L+:** Overnight gear (camping equipment, extra clothes)

**Waterproof Options:**
- **Roll-top dry bags:** $15-60 depending on size (Sea to Summit, Earth Pak)
- **Dry boxes:** Hard cases ($20-80) for fragile electronics (Pelican, Plano)
- **Ziploc freezer bags:** Free/cheap backup (double-bag important items)
- **Phone waterproof cases:** $10-30 (test in sink before trusting on river)

**Pro Tip:** Assume everything will get wet. Even "dry" bags can leak if not sealed properly. Test seals at home in bathtub or sink.

### Sun Protection

**Missouri Summer Reality:** 95°F heat index + 8 hours on reflective water = serious sunburn risk.

**Essential Sun Gear:**
- **Sunscreen:** SPF 30+ broad-spectrum, water-resistant
  - Apply 30 minutes before launch
  - Reapply every 2 hours (more if swimming)
  - Reef-safe formulas (protect aquatic life)
- **Sunglasses:** Polarized lenses reduce glare, protect eyes
  - Secure strap (Croakies, Chums) prevents loss in water
  - Floating models or attach to PFD
- **Hat:** Wide brim (3"+) or cap with neck flap
  - Secure chin strap or tether to PFD
  - Light colors reflect heat
- **Lip balm:** SPF 30+ (lips burn easily, often forgotten)

**Budget Options:**
- Coppertone Sport sunscreen: $8-12 (4 oz)
- Generic polarized sunglasses: $15-25 (Walmart, Academy)
- Straw hat with chin strap: $10-20

**Pro Tip:** Apply sunscreen before leaving home. Sunburn starts in first hour on water, when you're focused on launching.

### Water Shoes and Footwear

**Why Not Flip-Flops:** Rivers have rocky bottoms, sharp debris, slippery algae. Flip-flops wash away in current.

**Best Options:**
- **Water shoes/sandals:** $20-60 (Keen, Merrell, Chaco)
  - Closed-toe protects from rocks
  - Secure straps (no slip-offs)
  - Quick-drying materials
- **Old sneakers:** Free (use worn-out running shoes)
  - Tie laces tight or double-knot
  - Will stay wet all day
- **Neoprene booties:** $15-40 (kayakers' choice for spring floats)

**Avoid:**
- Barefoot (sharp rocks, broken glass, fish hooks)
- Flip-flops/slides (slip off easily)
- Heavy hiking boots (won't dry, uncomfortable when wet)

## Food and Beverages

### Food Packing

**Day Trip Essentials:**
- **Breakfast (early launch):** Breakfast burritos, muffins, fruit
- **Lunch:** Sandwiches, wraps, chips, trail mix
- **Snacks:** Energy bars, jerky, crackers, fresh fruit (apples, oranges)

**Food Tips:**
- Pre-make sandwiches at home (less mess on river)
- Pack in Ziplocs or reusable containers (keeps dry, reduces trash)
- Avoid foods that spoil quickly (mayo, dairy) in hot weather
- Bring trash bags (pack out everything—Leave No Trace)

**Budget Options:**
- DIY sandwiches: $5-10 per person
- Trail mix bulk bins: $3-5 per pound
- Grocery deli sandwiches: $5-7 each (ready-made, no prep)

### Beverages

**Hydration First:**
- **1 gallon water per person** (8 hours, hot weather)
- Sports drinks (electrolytes for hot days)
- Avoid excessive caffeine (dehydrating)

**Alcohol Considerations:**
- **Legal:** Drinking is allowed on Missouri rivers
- **Smart limits:** Dehydration + heat + alcohol = heat exhaustion risk
- **Float-friendly options:** Canned beer (lighter, less breakage than bottles)
- **1:1 rule:** One water for every alcoholic drink

**Glass Ban:** Some rivers prohibit glass containers (check local regulations). Use cans or plastic.

**Pro Tip:** Freeze juice boxes or Capri Suns overnight—they act as ice packs and thaw into cold drinks by afternoon.

## Comfort and Convenience Items

### Clothing

**What to Wear:**
- **Swimsuit:** You will get wet (even if you don't plan to swim)
- **Quick-dry shorts/shirt:** Nylon, polyester (avoid cotton—stays wet, heavy, cold)
- **Long-sleeve rashguard:** Extra sun protection (SPF-rated options available)
- **Hat with strap:** Prevents loss in wind/water

**Extra Clothes (in dry bag):**
- Dry shirt and shorts (for after float)
- Underwear
- Socks (if wearing water shoes all day)
- Light jacket/hoodie (spring floats, evening cool-downs)

**Avoid:**
- Jeans (heavy when wet, take forever to dry)
- Cotton t-shirts (cold when wet, don't dry)
- Expensive jewelry (risk of loss)

### Camp Chairs and Comfort

**River Stop Essentials:**
- **Portable camp chair:** $15-40 (folds small, clips to cooler)
  - Great for gravel bars, lunch stops
  - Not necessary in canoe/kayak (built-in seats)
- **Dry towel:** For drying off during stops (keep in dry bag)
- **Sunshade/umbrella:** Clip-on boat umbrella ($20-40) for long floats

**Budget Options:**
- Walmart camp chairs: $10-25 (lightweight, compact)
- Beach towel: Free (use existing towel, pack in dry bag)

### Electronics and Entertainment

**Waterproof Electronics:**
- **Phone in waterproof case:** Navigation, photos, emergency calls
  - Test case beforehand (submerge in sink for 30 min)
  - Bring portable charger (in dry bag)
- **Waterproof camera:** GoPro ($200-500) or disposable waterproof ($15-20)
- **Portable Bluetooth speaker:** Waterproof models ($30-100)
  - Be considerate of other floaters (volume, distance)
  - Check battery life (8+ hours for full-day float)

**Entertainment:**
- Playing cards in Ziploc (for lunch stops)
- Fishing gear (if licensed)
- Frisbee or football (for gravel bar stops)

**Pro Tip:** Bring a backup battery pack. Phone batteries drain fast in hot weather, and you'll want photos.

## Seasonal Considerations

### Spring Float Trips (March-May)

**Weather Challenges:**
- Water temperature: 50-65°F (cold!)
- Air temperature: 60-80°F (variable)
- Rain risk: Higher precipitation, flash flood potential

**Spring-Specific Gear:**
- **Wetsuit or neoprene:** Water is cold—hypothermia risk if you flip
- **Waterproof jacket:** Rain gear essential (pack in dry bag)
- **Dry bag for warm clothes:** Change immediately if you get soaked
- **Neoprene gloves:** Hands get cold paddling in cold water

**Spring Advantages:**
- Higher water levels (faster floats, fewer shallow spots)
- Fewer crowds (weekdays especially)
- Wildflowers, green scenery

### Summer Float Trips (June-August)

**Weather Challenges:**
- Water temperature: 70-75°F (comfortable)
- Air temperature: 85-100°F (HOT)
- Heat index: Often 100°F+ on water (sun reflection intensifies)

**Summer-Specific Gear:**
- **Extra sunscreen:** Reapply every 2 hours
- **Wide-brim hat:** Maximum sun protection
- **Cooling towel:** Soak in river, wear around neck
- **Extra water:** 1.5 gallons per person (dehydration risk)
- **Electrolyte drinks:** Replenish salts lost to sweating

**Summer Advantages:**
- Warm water (swimming is refreshing, not shocking)
- Long daylight (more time on river)
- Peak outfitter services (full rental options)

### Fall Float Trips (September-October)

**Weather Challenges:**
- Water temperature: 60-70°F (cooling down)
- Air temperature: 60-80°F (pleasant)
- Lower water levels (more shallow spots, slower floats)

**Fall-Specific Gear:**
- **Layers:** Mornings cool, afternoons warm
- **Long sleeves:** Cooler water/air combo
- **Dry bag for jacket:** Pack light fleece or windbreaker

**Fall Advantages:**
- Beautiful foliage (October peak colors)
- Fewer crowds (post-summer rush)
- Mild temperatures (comfortable paddling)

## What NOT to Bring

### Common Mistakes

**Leave These at Home:**
- **Glass bottles:** Break easily, illegal on some rivers, dangerous for barefoot waders
- **Styrofoam coolers (long-term):** Break apart, litter, not eco-friendly
- **Expensive electronics (unprotected):** Will get wet, lost, or damaged
- **Valuables/jewelry:** Risk of loss in water
- **Pets (without preparation):** Need PFDs, shade, water, and leash compliance
- **Aerosol sunscreen:** Often banned (flammable, environmental concerns)
- **Drones:** Check local regulations (many parks prohibit)

### Environmental Concerns

**Protect Missouri's Rivers:**
- **No disposable plastics:** Pack out all trash (including bottle caps, straws)
- **Reef-safe sunscreen:** Chemical sunscreens harm aquatic life
- **Biodegradable soap:** If washing dishes, use eco-friendly options away from river
- **No dumping:** Leftover food, drinks, waste—pack it all out

**Leave No Trace Principles:**
1. Plan ahead and prepare
2. Travel and camp on durable surfaces
3. Dispose of waste properly (pack it out)
4. Leave what you find (rocks, plants, artifacts)
5. Minimize campfire impacts (use established fire rings)
6. Respect wildlife (observe from distance)
7. Be considerate of other visitors (noise, space)

## Outfitter Rentals vs. Own Gear

### What Outfitters Provide

**Standard Rental Package ($40-70/person):**
