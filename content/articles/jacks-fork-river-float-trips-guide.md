## Why Float the Jacks Fork River

If you're searching for Missouri's most untouched and scenic float trip experience, the Jacks Fork River should be at the top of your list. As part of the **Ozark National Scenic Riverways**—America's first national park created to protect a river system—the Jacks Fork offers crystal-clear spring-fed water, towering limestone bluffs that rise 200 feet above the river, hidden caves with spectacular entrances, and some of the most rugged and pristine wilderness scenery in the Missouri Ozarks.

The Jacks Fork is less crowded than its famous neighbor the Current River, making it perfect for paddlers seeking a more wilderness-focused experience. The upper section above Alley Spring is particularly remote and challenging, attracting experienced paddlers who want to test their skills on Class I-II water while surrounded by deep, narrow valleys that feel a world away from civilization.

Whether you're an experienced canoeist ready to tackle the challenging upper river in spring, a family looking for a relaxing day float from Alley Spring to Eminence, or someone who simply wants to camp under the stars on a pristine gravel bar while listening to the river flow past, the Jacks Fork delivers an unforgettable Missouri Ozarks adventure.

**Key highlights that make Jacks Fork unique:**

- **Pristine wilderness character** - Less developed and more remote than Current River
- **Jam Up Cave** - One of Missouri's most spectacular cave entrances visible from the river
- **Alley Spring** - Historic gristmill and one of Missouri's largest springs (81 million gallons daily)
- **Challenging upper section** - Class I-II rapids for experienced paddlers (spring only)
- **Year-round lower section** - Alley Spring to Two Rivers floatable all year
- **Exceptional fishing** - Smallmouth bass, goggle-eye, and six endemic Ozark fish species
- **Wild horses** - Occasionally spotted roaming freely along the river
- **Bald eagle sightings** - Particularly during spring and winter months
- **Crystal-clear water** - Spring-fed clarity perfect for swimming and spotting fish
- **Protected status** - Part of Ozark National Scenic Riverways since 1964

## River Overview

### Geography & Location

The Jacks Fork River flows approximately **46-49 miles** through Shannon and Texas counties in southeastern Missouri. The river begins at the confluence of the North Prong and South Prong near Mountain View and flows eastward through the heart of the Ozark highlands before joining the Current River near the town of Eminence at a location appropriately named **Two Rivers**.

The Jacks Fork is entirely contained within the **Ozark National Scenic Riverways**, managed by the National Park Service. This designation, established in 1964, protects the river's free-flowing character, water quality, and the surrounding forests, glades, caves, and springs that make this region so special.

### River Characteristics

**Water Source:** The Jacks Fork is a spring-fed river, meaning its flow comes primarily from hundreds of freshwater springs emerging from the Ozark limestone. The most notable of these is Alley Spring, which contributes 81 million gallons daily to the river. This spring-fed nature keeps the water cold (typically 55-60°F), clear, and at relatively consistent levels compared to rain-dependent streams.

**River Classification:** The Jacks Fork ranges from **Class I to Class II**, depending on the section and water levels. The upper section above Alley Spring features faster current, narrow channels, and occasional technical maneuvers requiring intermediate paddling skills. The lower section from Alley Spring to Two Rivers is generally Class I—gentle and suitable for beginners and families.

**Scenery:** The Jacks Fork is renowned for its dramatic topography. Deep, narrow valleys with steep hillsides create an intimate, enclosed feeling rare on Missouri float streams. Towering **dolomite bluffs rise 150-200 feet** above the water, their faces adorned with ancient eastern red cedars clinging to narrow ledges. The river corridor supports over 450 native plant species and is habitat for wild horses, black bears, bald eagles, and rare birds like the cerulean warbler.

### Historical Background

The river takes its name from **John Jacks** (sometimes called "Captain Jack"), a Shawnee Indian who settled near the headwaters in the 1830s. According to local legend, Jacks and his tribe camped along the river, which European settlers then named "Jack's Fork" to distinguish it from other nearby streams.

The upper Jacks Fork valley remained relatively isolated well into the 20th century. Unlike other Ozark rivers reached by railroad logging trams, the rugged hills along the Jacks Fork were logged using wagons to haul timber to mills at Birch Tree. This limited logging activity, combined with the area's designation as a national park in 1964, has allowed the valley to retain much of its primeval character.

Today, the Jacks Fork is recognized as one of Missouri's premier wilderness float streams, attracting paddlers who value pristine scenery and solitude over convenience and crowds.

## Best Time to Float

### Upper Jacks Fork (Prongs to Alley Spring): **Spring Only**

The **upper 30 miles** of the Jacks Fork—from the confluence of the North and South Prongs down to Alley Spring—is a **seasonal float**. This section is only floatable during **spring months (March through early June)** when rainfall and snowmelt provide sufficient water depth.

**Ideal window:** Mid-March through May  
**Water level threshold:** Generally need 2.8-3.0 feet or higher at the Mountain View gauge  
**Why it's worth it:** The upper Jacks Fork offers the most remote, challenging, and scenically stunning paddling in Missouri. Expect Class I-II rapids, narrow channels, cascading water through mountain valleys, and almost zero development or crowds.

**Expert tip:** Check the [USGS water gauge at Mountain View (07065200)](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/USGS-07065200/) before planning a trip above Alley Spring. Anything below 2.8 feet is too low for most paddlers and will involve frequent dragging and portaging. By early June, this section is typically too shallow to float until the following spring.

### Lower Jacks Fork (Alley Spring to Two Rivers): **Year-Round**

The **lower 14 miles** from Alley Spring to the Current River confluence is **floatable year-round** thanks to the massive flow contribution from Alley Spring (81 million gallons daily). This section maintains consistent water levels even during summer droughts and winter low-flow periods.

**Spring (March-May):**
- **Best for:** Wildflowers, migrating warblers, comfortable temperatures
- **Water temp:** Cool (55-60°F)
- **Crowds:** Moderate, increasing toward Memorial Day
- **Considerations:** Higher water levels make swimming spots deeper; occasional spring rain can cause temporary muddiness

**Summer (June-August):**
- **Best for:** Swimming, hot weather relief, family trips
- **Water temp:** Still cool (58-62°F), refreshing on hot days
- **Crowds:** Peak season, especially weekends and July 4th week
- **Considerations:** Gravel bars can be crowded; reservations essential; afternoon thunderstorms common

**Fall (September-November):**
- **Best for:** Fall foliage (mid-October peak), solitude, mild weather
- **Water temp:** Comfortable for paddling (60-65°F), cool for swimming
- **Crowds:** Very light after Labor Day
- **Considerations:** Beautiful autumn colors, fewer insects, excellent fishing

**Winter (December-February):**
- **Best for:** Solitude, winter scenery, bald eagle viewing
- **Water temp:** Very cold (45-50°F)
- **Crowds:** Almost none
- **Considerations:** Dress for cold-weather paddling; some outfitters operate limited schedules or by appointment only; stunning when snow covers the ground and bluffs

### Water Level Guidance

**Eminence Gauge (07066000):** This gauge measures the lower Jacks Fork at Eminence and is the most relevant for planning trips from Alley Spring downstream.

- **Below 3.0 feet:** Low but floatable; expect some dragging on riffles
- **3.0-4.5 feet:** Ideal conditions for most paddlers
- **4.5-6.0 feet:** Good to high water; faster current, fewer obstacles
- **Above 6.0 feet:** High water; suitable for experienced paddlers only
- **Above 8.0 feet:** Flood stage; dangerous conditions, avoid floating

**Real-time water levels:**  
[USGS Gauge at Eminence](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/USGS-07066000/)  
[USGS Gauge at Mountain View](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/USGS-07065200/)

**Flash flood warning:** The Jacks Fork watershed is susceptible to flash flooding, especially during spring storms. Always check the weather forecast before your trip. If heavy rain is predicted, postpone your float. Never camp on low gravel bars during stormy weather—move to higher ground.

## What Makes Jacks Fork Special

### Jam Up Cave

One of Missouri's most spectacular cave entrances awaits at approximately river mile 12. **Jam Up Cave** (also called Jam Up Bluff and Cave) features an entrance arch that measures **80 feet high by 100 feet wide**—visible from the river and absolutely breathtaking.

Technically classified as a natural tunnel rather than a traditional cave, Jam Up Cave is formed where Jam Up Creek flows into the opening through a narrow sinkhole above. Huge dolomite boulders form a dramatic talus slope below the entrance. In daylight, you can peer into the cave and see where it opens to a subterranean lake—the plunge basin for falls from the upper part of the cave system.

**Important:** Jam Up Cave, along with many caves in the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, is **closed to entry** to protect bat populations from White Nose Syndrome, a fungal disease devastating bat populations across North America. You can admire and photograph the entrance from the river, but do not enter the cave. This closure helps protect critical bat habitat.

### Alley Spring & Historic Mill

**Alley Spring** is one of the largest springs in Missouri, discharging an average of **81 million gallons per day** of crystal-clear, 58-degree water. The spring emerges from a cave opening and flows through a half-mile spring branch before entering the Jacks Fork River.

The spring's bright blue-green color comes from dissolved dolomite (a type of limestone) in the Ozark aquifer. Rainfall and runoff entering sinkholes around the town of Summersville, about 15 miles northwest, travels through a labyrinth of underground cave passages before emerging at Alley Spring.

Adjacent to the spring stands the **Alley Mill**, a beautiful red gristmill built in 1894. The mill used Alley Spring's powerful flow to grind grain for local farmers. Today, the mill is preserved as a historic site by the National Park Service and is one of the most photographed locations in the Missouri Ozarks.

**What to do at Alley Spring:**
- Tour the historic gristmill (seasonal hours)
- Swim in the cold spring branch
- Picnic in the shaded grounds
- Photograph the mill and spring
- Camp at the full-service campground
- Begin your float trip on the lower Jacks Fork

### Wildlife & Biodiversity

The Jacks Fork River corridor is home to extraordinary biodiversity, earning its designation as an **Ozark natural area** of conservation significance.

**Fish:** The river supports **40 native fish species**, including six Ozark endemics (species found nowhere else on Earth):
- Ozark madtom
- Checkered madtom
- Ozark shiner
- Current River saddled darter
- Ozark chub
- Ozark sculpin

Anglers prize the Jacks Fork for **smallmouth bass, goggle-eye (shadow bass), sunfishes, and perch**. The cold, clear, spring-fed water creates ideal habitat for these species.

**Crayfish:** Four crayfish species live in the Jacks Fork, three of them Ozark endemics:
- Hubb's crayfish
- Ozark crayfish
- Spothanded crayfish

**Birds:** The Jacks Fork valley is a birding paradise, especially during spring migration when warblers move through the forested bluffs. Species to watch for:
- **Bald eagles** (particularly winter months)
- **Red-shouldered hawks** soaring above the valley
- **Belted kingfishers** diving for fish
- **Louisiana waterthrush** bobbing along rocky shores
- **Eastern phoebes** nesting on cliff ledges
- **Northern parula warblers**
- **Yellow-throated warblers**
- **Cerulean warblers** (rare, high in sycamores)

**Mammals:**
- **Wild horses** roam freely along the Jacks Fork and are occasionally spotted from the river
- Black bears (present but rarely seen)
- White-tailed deer (common, especially mornings and evenings)
- Raccoons, opossums, and other small mammals

**Plants:** Over **450 native plant species** occur in the Jacks Fork Natural Area, including rare "glacial relict" species like harebell. These northern plants survive in the cool microclimates of north-facing cliffs—remnants of the cooler climate 12,000 years ago during the last Ice Age.

### Towering Bluffs & Geological Wonders

The Jacks Fork flows through **deep, narrow valleys** carved over millions of years into Ordovician-age dolomite and limestone. Towering bluffs rise **150-200 feet** above the river, creating dramatic scenery and a sense of intimacy rare on Missouri rivers.

**Eastern red cedars** cling to narrow cliff ledges, their gnarled trunks twisted by centuries of wind and weather. These ancient trees, some hundreds of years old, add to the wilderness character of the river.

Steep valley walls and cliffs support rare plant communities found nowhere else in Missouri. The cool, shaded north-facing bluffs host glacial relict plants normally found in more northern states.

**Cave systems** riddle the limestone beneath the Jacks Fork watershed. While many caves are closed to protect bats, the visible entrances—like Jam Up Cave—offer glimpses into the vast underground world beneath the Ozarks.

### Solitude & Wilderness Character

Unlike the Current River, which sees heavy summer traffic, the Jacks Fork offers a **more remote and wilderness-focused experience**. The upper river above Alley Spring is particularly isolated, with limited access points and long stretches where you'll see no development—just forest, bluffs, and river.

Even the popular lower section from Alley Spring to Eminence is less crowded than comparable Current River floats. If you're seeking solitude, avoid summer weekends and holidays. Spring (before Memorial Day) and fall offer the best combination of good weather and low crowds.

- **Camp on gravel, not vegetation:** Protects fragile riparian plants
- **Camp above high-water line:** Check for debris caught in trees indicating flood levels
- **Minimize campfire impact:** Use existing fire rings; burn only downed wood; extinguish completely
- **Pack out all trash:** Leave No Trace principles apply
- **Human waste:** Bury at least 200 feet from water in a cat hole 6-8 inches deep
- **Respect wildlife:** Store food securely (raccoons are common); don't feed animals
- **Respect other campers:** Keep noise down, especially after dark

**Tips:**
- Arrive at your intended camping area by mid-afternoon to claim a spot (summer weekends fill up)
- Bring all necessary gear (tent, sleeping bag, stove, food)

## Fishing on the Jacks Fork

The Jacks Fork River offers **world-renowned fishing** for smallmouth bass and other Ozark stream species. The cold, clear, spring-fed water and diverse habitat—deep pools, fast riffles, undercut banks, submerged logs—create ideal conditions for a thriving fish population.

### Target Species

**Smallmouth bass:** The prize catch on the Jacks Fork. These hard-fighting fish thrive in the cold, oxygen-rich water. Target them in pools below riffles, near submerged boulders, along undercut banks, and in the shade of overhanging trees.

**Goggle-eye (shadow bass, rock bass):** Abundant and aggressive. Excellent for kids and beginning anglers. Found near rocky structure and in moderate current.

**Sunfishes:** Longear sunfish, green sunfish, bluegill, and other panfish are plentiful. Fun on light tackle.

**Perch:** Good populations in slower pools.

**Endemic species (catch-and-release only):** Six Ozark endemic fish species live in the Jacks Fork—Ozark madtom, checkered madtom, Ozark shiner, Current River saddled darter, Ozark chub, and Ozark sculpin. If you catch these rare species, handle gently and release immediately.

### Best Fishing Seasons

**Spring (March-May):** Excellent. Water temperatures ideal for smallmouth bass activity. Fish actively feed after winter. Spring insect hatches bring fish to the surface.

**Summer (June-August):** Good, especially early mornings and evenings. Midday heat can slow fishing, but shaded pools and deeper holes still produce.

**Fall (September-November):** Excellent. Cooling water temperatures trigger aggressive feeding. Fall is considered peak smallmouth season by many anglers.

**Winter (December-February):** Fair to good. Fish move to deeper pools and slow down, but patient anglers can still catch smallmouth in warmer afternoon hours.

### Regulations

- **Missouri fishing license required** for anyone 16 and older
- Check current [Missouri Department of Conservation regulations](https://mdc.mo.gov/) for size limits, creel limits, and seasonal restrictions
- **Special regulations** may apply within Ozark National Scenic Riverways—verify with the National Park Service before fishing

### Gear Recommendations

**Rods & reels:**
- Medium-light to medium spinning or baitcasting rods (6-7 feet)
- Reel with smooth drag for fighting smallmouth
- 6-10 lb test monofilament or fluorocarbon line

**Lures:**
- **Soft plastics:** Tube jigs, crawfish imitations, creature baits
- **Crankbaits:** Small to medium diving crankbaits in natural colors
- **Topwater:** Poppers, buzzbaits (especially early morning and evening)
- **Spinnerbaits:** Inline spinners, small spinnerbaits
- **Jigs:** Hair jigs, marabou jigs (Ozark classics)

**Live bait:**
- Crickets, grasshoppers (deadly on goggle-eye and sunfish)
- Nightcrawlers
- Minnows (check regulations—some areas restrict live bait)

**Fly fishing:**
- 4-6 weight rod
- Floating line
- Streamers, poppers, nymphs, wooly buggers

### Where to Fish

- **Pools below riffles:** Prime smallmouth habitat
- **Undercut banks:** Fish hold in shade and ambush prey
- **Boulders and rocky structure:** Create current breaks where fish rest
- **Log jams and downed trees:** Provide cover and attract baitfish
- **Deep pools:** Especially productive in summer heat and winter cold
- **Spring branches:** Cool, oxygen-rich water attracts fish

## Safety & River Conditions

### Water Levels & Flash Flooding

The Jacks Fork watershed is prone to **flash flooding** during heavy rainstorms, especially in spring. Water levels can rise rapidly—sometimes several feet in an hour—turning a calm float into a dangerous torrent.

**Before your trip:**
- Check the [USGS water gauges](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/) for current levels
- Review the weather forecast for the entire watershed (storms upstream can cause flooding downstream even if skies are clear where you are)
- Postpone your trip if heavy rain is forecast

**During your trip:**
- Monitor weather conditions (carry a weather radio or smartphone if signal available)
- If you hear thunder or see dark clouds, head to shore immediately
- Never camp on low gravel bars during stormy weather—move to higher ground
- If caught in rapidly rising water, abandon gear if necessary and get to high ground

**Flood stage at Eminence gauge:** 8.0 feet. Avoid floating when levels exceed this threshold.

### Cold Water Temperatures

The Jacks Fork is **spring-fed**, meaning water temperatures remain cold year-round:
- Spring/Fall: 55-60°F
- Summer: 58-65°F
- Winter: 45-50°F

**Cold water risks:**
- **Hypothermia:** Prolonged exposure to cold water can cause life-threatening hypothermia even in summer
- **Cold water shock:** Sudden immersion in cold water can cause gasping, hyperventilation, and panic

**Precautions:**
- Wear a **life jacket** (required by law; also provides thermal protection if you capsize)
- Dress in layers; bring a dry change of clothes in a waterproof bag
- If you capsize, stay calm, get back in your boat or swim to shore quickly
- Know the signs of hypothermia: shivering, confusion, slurred speech, drowsiness. If symptoms appear, warm the person immediately and seek medical help.

### Paddling Skills

**Upper Jacks Fork (above Alley Spring):**
- Requires **intermediate to advanced paddling skills**
- Narrow channels, swift current, occasional Class II rapids
- Must be able to read water, navigate around obstacles, and execute quick maneuvers
- Not suitable for beginners or young children
- Seasonal only—check water levels before committing

**Lower Jacks Fork (Alley Spring to Two Rivers):**
- **Beginner-friendly**
- Gentle current, mostly Class I water
- Suitable for families, first-time paddlers, young children
- Occasional riffles require basic paddling skills but nothing technical

### Hazards to Avoid

**Strainers:** Fallen trees and log jams create "strainers"—obstacles that allow water to flow through but trap boats and people. Avoid strainers at all costs. If you see a strainer ahead, paddle away from it immediately. If caught, climb on top of the log, do not try to dive under.

**Low-head dams:** There are no major dams on the Jacks Fork, but be aware of this hazard on other rivers.

**Undercut rocks:** Some large boulders have undercut sides that can trap paddlers. Give these obstacles a wide berth.

**Submerged rocks:** Clear water makes it easy to spot rocks, but swift current can push you onto them before you react. Always scout ahead and plan your line through rocky sections.

### Life Jackets (PFDs)

**Missouri law requires:**
- A U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jacket (Personal Flotation Device) for **every person on the boat**
- Life jackets must be **properly sized** and in **good condition**
- Children **12 and under** must **wear** life jackets at all times while on the water

**Best practices:**
- Everyone should **wear** life jackets, not just have them in the boat
- Choose comfortable, well-fitting PFDs to encourage compliance
- Bright colors aid in visibility if rescue is needed

### Alcohol & Safety

**Missouri law prohibits:**
- Operating a vessel while intoxicated (BWI—Boating While Intoxicated)
- BAC limit: 0.08% (same as driving)

**Reality check:** Floating and drinking are culturally common in Missouri, but alcohol significantly increases drowning risk. If you choose to drink:
- Designate a sober paddler
- Limit consumption
- Never drink if water levels are high or conditions are challenging
- Absolutely no drinking on the upper river or other technical sections

### Emergency Preparedness

**What to bring:**
- First aid kit
- Whistle (signals for help)
- Waterproof flashlight or headlamp
- Weather radio or smartphone
- Sunscreen and insect repellent
- Water and snacks
- Map of the river
- Dry bag with extra clothes

**Know before you go:**
- Cell phone coverage is **spotty** to **nonexistent** on much of the Jacks Fork
- The nearest hospital is in **Eminence** or **West Plains**
- In true emergencies, call **911** if you have signal, or send someone downstream to the nearest access point to summon help
