# Gauge Threshold Recalibration Summary

Based on detailed feedback from Missouri Scenic Rivers website and local paddler/outfitter experience, the following threshold adjustments have been made to match real-world conditions.

## Current River

### Akers Gauge (07064533) - Upper Current River
**Source**: https://missouriscenicrivers.com/current-river-levels

| Threshold | Old Value | New Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Too Low | 1.5 ft | **1.0 ft** | Admin's personal cut-off for empty canoe; floated at 1.32 ft with dragging |
| Low | 2.0 ft | **1.5 ft** | Average level per feedback; some dragging expected below this |
| Optimal Min | 2.5 ft | **2.0 ft** | Feedback states "below 2.0 ft you may drag" |
| Optimal Max | 4.0 ft | **3.5 ft** | Buffer before close level; keeps optimal range tighter |
| High | 5.0 ft | **4.0 ft** | **Flood level - NPS closes river at 4.0 ft per Ranger Skyler Bockman** |
| Dangerous | 7.0 ft | **4.5 ft** | Anything above close level is dangerous |

**Key Feedback**:
- Average: ~1.5 ft
- Personal cut-off: 1.0 ft empty, 1.2 ft loaded
- NPS closes at 4.0 ft flood stage, not 2.0 ft
- 1.82 ft still murky from rain; prefers 1.5 ft for crystal clear water

### Van Buren Gauge (07067000) - Lower Current River
**Source**: https://missouriscenicrivers.com/current-river-levels

| Threshold | Old Value | New Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Too Low | 2.0 ft | **2.5 ft** | Average is 3.4 ft, so too low should be higher |
| Low | 2.5 ft | **3.0 ft** | Marginal floating |
| Optimal Min | 3.0 ft | **3.2 ft** | Closer to 3.4 ft average |
| Optimal Max | 4.5 ft | **4.0 ft** | Tubes best below 4.0 ft |
| High | 5.0 ft | **4.5 ft** | General floating < 4.5 ft; motor vessels only 4.5-5.0 ft |
| Dangerous | 8.0 ft | **5.0 ft** | **Flood level per feedback** |

**Key Feedback**:
- Average: ~3.4 ft
- General floating recommended: < 4.5 ft
- Motor vessels only: 4.5-5.0 ft
- Tubes best below 4.0 ft (can go to 4.5 with caution)
- Flood level: 5.0 ft

### Doniphan Gauge (07066000) - Lower Current River
**Source**: https://missouriscenicrivers.com/current-river-levels

| Threshold | Old Value | New Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Too Low | 3.0 ft | **0.5 ft** | Average is only 1.0 ft! Much wider channel = lower readings |
| Low | 4.0 ft | **0.8 ft** | Marginal level |
| Optimal Min | 4.5 ft | **1.0 ft** | Average level per feedback |
| Optimal Max | 8.0 ft | **2.5 ft** | Upper comfortable range |
| High | 10.0 ft | **4.0 ft** | High water |
| Dangerous | 15.0 ft | **6.0 ft** | Approaching flood stage (13 ft) |

**Key Feedback**:
- Average: ~1.0 ft (significantly lower than Van Buren!)
- Flood stage: 13 ft
- This gauge reads much lower due to wider, deeper channel

## Jacks Fork

### Alley Spring Gauge (07065200) - Lower Jacks Fork
**Source**: https://missouriscenicrivers.com/jacks-fork-levels

| Threshold | Old Value | New Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Too Low | 1.2 ft | **1.0 ft** | Significant dragging |
| Low | 1.5 ft | **1.3 ft** | Some dragging expected |
| Optimal Min | 2.0 ft | **1.5 ft** | Average level, minimal dragging |
| Optimal Max | 3.5 ft | **3.5 ft** | ✓ No change - already correct |
| High | 4.0 ft | **4.0 ft** | ✓ No change - river closes here |
| Dangerous | 6.0 ft | **5.3 ft** | Flood level per feedback |

**Key Feedback**:
- Average: ~1.5 ft
- Below 1.5 ft: may drag, especially if fully loaded
- Close at 4.0 ft
- Flood level: 5.3 ft

### Buck Hollow Gauge (07064533) - Upper Jacks Fork
**Note**: This gauge may not be configured in the system yet. If it exists, should be calibrated as:
- Too Low: 1.0 ft
- Low: 1.5 ft
- Optimal Min: 2.0 ft (2021: "reasonable for light boat")
- Optimal Max: 3.5 ft
- High: 4.0 ft (Parks closes)
- Dangerous: 4.5 ft

**Key Feedback**:
- Average: ~1.0 ft
- Ted Haviland (2021): "Anything over 2.0 reasonable for light boat, 2.5 with gear"
- Good between 2.5-3.5 ft
- Below 2.5 ft: gonna drag some
- 4.0 ft: flood stage (Parks closes)

## Eleven Point River

### Bardley Gauge (07071500)
**Source**: https://missouriscenicrivers.com/eleven-point-levels

| Threshold | Old Value | New Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Too Low | 2.0 ft | **2.5 ft** | Too shallow |
| Low | 2.5 ft | **2.8 ft** | Marginal |
| Optimal Min | 3.0 ft | **3.0 ft** | ✓ No change - matches average |
| Optimal Max | 5.5 ft | **3.5 ft** | **Feedback: "3-3.5 ft optimal", 4+ ft undesirable** |
| High | 7.0 ft | **4.5 ft** | 4-5 ft experienced only |
| Dangerous | 10.0 ft | **5.0 ft** | **Forest Service closes at 5 ft** |

**Key Feedback**:
- Average: ~3.0 ft
- **Optimal: 3.0-3.5 ft** (very specific!)
- 4+ ft: undesirable due to heavy rains (murky/muddy)
- 4-5 ft: experienced floaters only
- **5 ft: Highest outfitters will put in; Forest Service closes river**
- Action level: 8 ft
- Flood stage: 10 ft

## Summary of Major Changes

### Most Significant Adjustments:

1. **Current River - Doniphan**: Completely recalibrated from 3.0-15.0 ft range to **0.5-6.0 ft** to match actual 1.0 ft average

2. **Eleven Point - Bardley**: Optimal max reduced from 5.5 ft to **3.5 ft** per specific feedback about 3-3.5 ft being optimal

3. **Current River - Akers**: High/dangerous thresholds lowered to **4.0/4.5 ft** based on NPS closure at 4.0 ft flood level

4. **Current River - Van Buren**: Dangerous threshold lowered from 8.0 ft to **5.0 ft** (actual flood level)

### Safety Improvements:

- All dangerous thresholds now align with actual flood levels and closure points
- Optimal ranges tightened to match local outfitter and experienced paddler recommendations
- Thresholds calibrated to real-world averages from Missouri Scenic Rivers website

## Implementation

This recalibration is implemented in migration `00020_recalibrate_thresholds.sql`. Run the migration to update all gauge thresholds in the database.
